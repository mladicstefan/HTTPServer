## C++ Webserver Built From Scratch

#### This server follows a multi-threaded Reactor pattern, using non-blocking sockets from the Linux API. Serving HTML CSS JS bundles, aswell as popular framework build files.
IMPORTANT: THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

A docker read-only image is coming by the end of the week, aswell as the full threat model + mitigation strategy. This webserver will be used to host my portfolio website. But it will also be reusable in any other way!

Stay tuned!
